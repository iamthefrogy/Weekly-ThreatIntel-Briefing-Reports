### 2. Notable Events & Assessments

#### Widespread Scanning Detected for Critical WSUS RCE Vulnerability
**What happened — Who/What is affected — Why it matters**
A significant increase in scanning activity targets a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). Exposed and unpatched servers are at high risk of compromise.

- **Facts:**
    *   The SANS Internet Storm Center reports a surge in scans for TCP ports 8530 and 8531 over the past week. These ports are used by WSUS for distributing updates 【<https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32440> (2025-11-03T05:00:05Z)】.
    *   The activity is linked to a recently disclosed vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-59287, which allows an attacker to execute scripts on a vulnerable server 【<https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32440> (2025-11-03T05:00:05Z)】.
    *   Sufficient details about the vulnerability are public, leading to the assessment that any exposed, vulnerable server should be considered compromised 【<https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32440> (2025-11-03T05:00:05Z)】.

- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **high confidence** that this scanning is a precursor to widespread, automated exploitation campaigns. The public availability of exploit details and the targeting of a ubiquitous enterprise service make it a highly attractive target for various threat actors.
    *   We assess that attackers exploiting this vulnerability will likely aim to establish initial access, followed by lateral movement and deployment of ransomware or other malware. Compromising WSUS provides a powerful pivot point to push malicious updates to all connected endpoints.

- **Relevance:**
    *   WSUS is a core component for managing patches and updates across our Windows environment. A compromise would have a catastrophic impact on system integrity and data security.
    *   The exposure pathway is any WSUS server with TCP ports 8530 or 8531 accessible from the internet or untrusted networks.

- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application
    *   T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter

- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   Monitor firewall and network logs for anomalous connection attempts or scanning activity directed at TCP ports 8530 and 8531.
    *   Sigma Rule Idea:
```yaml\n        title: Inbound Scan on WSUS Ports\n        logsource:\n          category: firewall\n        detection:\n          selection:\n            DestinationPort:\n              - '8530'\n              - '8531'\n          condition: selection | count(SourceIp) by DestinationPort > 10\n        ```
    *   Hunt for unusual processes spawned by the WSUS service (`wsusservice.exe`) on WSUS servers.

- **Mitigations:**
    *   Prioritize applying the relevant Microsoft patch for CVE-2025-59287 immediately.
    *   Restrict network access to WSUS servers. Ensure ports 8530 and 8531 are not exposed to the internet and are only accessible from trusted internal management networks.

#### Anthropic Claude AI Vulnerability Allows Data Exfiltration via Prompt Injection
**What happened — Who/What is affected — Why it matters**
A security researcher discovered a critical vulnerability in Anthropic's Claude AI assistant that allows an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as chat history and uploaded documents, by abusing the Code Interpreter feature via an indirect prompt injection attack.

- **Facts:**
    *   The vulnerability allows an attacker to embed malicious commands within a document or website that a user submits to Claude for analysis 【<https://www.cio.com/article/4083072/%ed%81%b4%eb%a1%9c%eb%93%9c-ai-%ec%b7%a8%ec%95%bd%ec%a0%90-%ec%bd%94%eb%93%9c-%ec%9d%b8%ed%84%b0%ed%94%84%eb%a6%ac%ed%84%b0-%ec%95%85%ec%9a%a9%ec%9c%8bc%eb%a1%9c-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%eb%8d%b0%ec%9d%b4.html> (2025-11-03T08:07:44Z)】.
    *   The malicious payload triggers Claude's Code Interpreter to save sensitive data to a file within its sandbox and then upload it using Anthropic's own file upload API (`api.anthropic.com`).
    *   The attack bypasses default network controls because `api.anthropic.com` is an allowed domain. The exfiltrated data is sent to an attacker-controlled account using the attacker's API key, leaving minimal trace in the victim's logs 【<https://www.cio.com/article/4083072/%ed%81%b4%eb%a1%9c%eb%93%9c-ai-%ec%b7%a8%ec%95%bd%ec%a0%90-%ec%bd%94%eb%93%9c-%ec%9d%b8%ed%84%b0%ed%94%84%eb%a6%ac%ed%84%b0-%ec%95%85%ec%9a%a9%ec%9c%bc%eb%a1%9c-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%eb%8d%b0%ec%9d%b4.html> (2025-11-03T08:07:44Z)】.
    *   Anthropic initially classified the report as "out of scope," considering it a model safety issue rather than a security vulnerability, though this is contested by the researcher 【<https://www.cio.com/article/4083072/%ed%81%b4%eb%a1%9c%eb%93%9c-ai-%ec%b7%a8%ec%95%bd%ec%a0%90-%ec%bd%94%eb%93%9c-%ec%9d%b8%ed%84%b0%ed%94%84%eb%a6%ac%ed%84%b0-%ec%95%85%ec%9a%a9%ec%9c%bc%eb%a1%9c-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%eb%8d%b0%ec%9d%b4.html> (2025-11-03T08:07:44Z)】.

- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **high confidence** that this represents a significant and novel threat vector for organizations utilizing AI assistants. The technique demonstrates how AI safety controls can be bypassed to create a security vulnerability, blurring the lines between the two disciplines.
    *   This attack is particularly dangerous because it's stealthy and leverages the AI platform's own infrastructure for data exfiltration, making it difficult to detect with traditional network monitoring.

- **Relevance:**
    *   This threat affects any organization or individual using AI assistants with advanced functionalities like code interpreters and file uploads for processing potentially untrusted data.
    *   There is a direct risk if employees use Claude or similar tools to analyze documents from external sources or summarize third-party websites, potentially exposing internal conversation histories and proprietary data.

- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1567.002: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage
    *   T1071.001: Web Protocols

- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   It is very difficult to detect this specific attack externally. Detection would rely on internal logging and monitoring capabilities provided by the AI vendor.
    *   Organizations should monitor for unusual patterns of file uploads originating from AI tools, although distinguishing malicious from benign activity is challenging.

- **Mitigations:**
    *   Update corporate acceptable use policies to prohibit uploading sensitive or proprietary documents to public AI assistants, especially those with code execution or internet-access features.
    *   If using such tools is necessary, disable network access within the AI's settings where possible, or use a strict allowlist for permitted domains.
    *   Educate employees about the risks of indirect prompt injection when using AI to process external content.

#### New Public Offensive Tools Threaten Endpoint Defenses and Microsoft Teams Security
**What happened — Who/What is affected — Why it matters**
Several new open-source tools have been released that enable attackers to bypass Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions and steal authentication cookies from the Microsoft Teams desktop application.

- **Facts:**
    *   **SilentButDeadly:** A tool that uses the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to block network communications from EDR/AV agents, preventing them from connecting to their cloud analysis platforms 【<https://github.com/loosehose/SilentButDeadly> (2025-11-03T08:30:36Z)】.
    *   **EDR-Redir V2:** An evasion tool that uses Windows bind links to redirect EDR file access, effectively faking the `Program Files` directory to bypass detections on Windows 11 【<https://gbhackers.com/edr-redir-v2-evades-detection-on-windows-11/> (2025-11-03T05:58:05Z)】.
    *   **Teams Cookies BOF:** A Beacon Object File (BOF) designed for Cobalt Strike that extracts authentication cookies from Microsoft Teams, allowing an attacker to impersonate users and access their chats, files, and emails 【<https://cybersecuritynews.com/bof-tool-exploits-microsoft-teams/> (2025-11-03T07:27:49Z)】, 【<https://tierzerosecurity.co.nz/2025/11/03/teams-cookies-bof.html> (2025-11-02T22:31:39Z)】.

- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **high confidence** that these publicly available tools will be quickly integrated into the playbooks of both red teams and malicious actors. They lower the barrier to entry for performing sophisticated EDR evasion and session hijacking.
    *   The focus on disrupting EDR telemetry and stealing cloud service tokens reflects a clear trend in attacker methodology to "live off the cloud" rather than just "living off the land," abusing legitimate access to SaaS platforms.

- **Relevance:**
    *   These tools directly threaten our endpoint security posture, which relies on EDR for visibility and response, and our collaboration environment, which heavily uses Microsoft Teams.
    *   An attacker successfully using these tools could operate undetected for longer periods and gain access to sensitive corporate communications and data stored in SharePoint and OneDrive.

- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1562.001: Disable or Modify Tools (EDR Evasion)
    *   T1562.004: Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall (WFP abuse)
    *   T1528: Steal Application Access Token
    *   T1552.006: Stored Account Information: Web Cookies

- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   Monitor for changes to Windows Filtering Platform rules not associated with legitimate software installation or Group Policy updates.
    *   Hunt for the use of `mklink.exe` or direct API calls creating symbolic or hard links in unusual locations, especially related to system or security software directories.
    *   Monitor for suspicious processes (e.g., from a C2 agent) accessing the Microsoft Teams cookie database, typically located at `"%AppData%\Microsoft\Teams\Cookies"`.

- **Mitigations:**
    *   Ensure defense-in-depth architecture is in place, so security does not rely solely on EDR.
    *   Implement robust application control to prevent unauthorized tools from running.
    *   Enhance monitoring of user session activity in M365 and enable conditional access policies that can detect and block anomalous sign-ins, even with a valid token.
